            Mitchell is 30 years old, he is a Australian born in Adelaide. As far as his culture goes, his great grandmother is aboriginal, but other then that he is Australian. Mitchell quite likes learning about the aboriginal culture, especially about "the dreaming". He has a certificate I&II in it from Charles Darwin University. Other that that he was enrolled in a bachelor in IT course online. However the service was so bad that he decided to quit and wait till online learning had improved. Mitchell knows quite a bit of the Japanese language as he has always been fascinated by their culture, this will help AusDev potentially expand internationally. Mitchell enjoy making things. Whether it is with his hands, or digital in a game. He likes to create and solve problems.

            Born in Darwin, moving to Melbourne, Adelaide and then Canberra. And traveling to a couple of south east Asian countries, Oliver has travelled and seen several different places. At times of rest, Oliver would enjoy both playing games and reading several books. During year 12, Oliver took a IT class where he learnt basic python coding which will be very important in developing key functions within AusDev. This is what started an interest in coding and IT.
